In my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class we explored different methods AI use to make plans to reach a goal with the lowest cost. Most of these planning techniques use the STRIPS logic language and correspond directly to physical movements and sensors of a robot. We needed to write STRIPS-centric code to show how we can make computers follow our logic and then how to create a plan for complex actions and goals.
In doing this I feel like I got to really demonstrate my knack for this kind of thought process. Working with computer logic often requires writing down information in a non-intuitive manner, however that format is very natural for me and allows me to optimize the logic code. It also demonstrates my ability to see the whole picture in the portions of the project in which I was writing how an AI program would plan in the "Blocks World" as I considered each of the possible factors the robot could encounter in moving blocks.
